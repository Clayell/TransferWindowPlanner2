# Transfer Window Planner 2

This is a new transfer window planning mod for KSP, based on the mathematical
routines in [MechJebLib](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2). It is heavily
inspired by TriggerAu's [original TWP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/84005--).

This mod depends on the dev version of MechJeb2. Specifically, it needs a build
after #1406. See
https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/?tab=readme-ov-file#development-version-of-mechjeb
for how to install this version of MechJeb using CKAN.
